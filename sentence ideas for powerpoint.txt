The aim of the project is to design and implement the 'Cost of Diet' application, improving its simplicity and usability. 
The system will be interfaced with a graphical user interface (GUI) written within Android Studio.

Any user with basic smart device experience that uses the program should find it simple, efficient and easy to use. 
The readability and navigation aspects of the system are simple for all types of users with photographs to help clarify.

The system is partially functional- further development is needed.
