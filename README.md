[Team CAPAE]

Building a android application for 'Save the Children' charity.

The GUI for the application is to be user friendly with many pictures to make it
very pictorial.

The finished product should be easy to use and the mother of the family must be
able to not feel threatened by the complexity and an easy understanding for her
to understand easily.

Simple colour but also quite friendly so it is opening and welcoming.
